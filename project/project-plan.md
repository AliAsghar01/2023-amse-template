# Project Plan

## Summary
This project aims to analyze parking violation data in Bonn to identify areas or streets with the highest frequency of parking violations. By integrating this information with the street directory dataset, the project will create a visualization and provide data-driven insights on parking violation hotspots. The results can assist urban planners, law enforcement agencies, and parking management companies in taking appropriate actions, such as improving signage, increasing patrolling, or adjusting parking regulations in those areas.

## Rationale
Parking violations are a common issue in urban areas, causing inconvenience to residents and visitors. By identifying parking violation hotspots, stakeholders can prioritize their efforts and resources to address the problem effectively. Understanding the areas or streets with the highest frequency of violations can help urban planners optimize parking infrastructure, law enforcement agencies enhance enforcement strategies, and parking management companies implement targeted solutions. This data-driven approach enables evidence-based decision-making and efficient allocation of resources.

## Datasources

### Datasource1: Parking Violation Data
* Metadata URL: https://mobilithek.info/offers/-4923391267684416470
* Data URL: https://opendata.bonn.de/sites/default/files/Parkverst%C3%B6%C3%9Fe%202021.csv
* Data Type: CSV

The parking violation dataset contains information about the date, time, location, and type of parking violations in Bonn. It provides a comprehensive record of parking offenses and serves as the primary data source for identifying hotspots.

### Datasource2: Street Directory Data
* Metadata URL: https://mobilithek.info/offers/-6188776794721161982
* Data URL: https://stadtplan.bonn.de/csv?Thema=17790
* Data Type: CSV

The street directory dataset contains information about the streets, roads, and intersections in Bonn, including their names, locations, and characteristics. Integrating this dataset with the parking violation data will enable the identification of specific streets or areas where parking violations occur frequently.

## Work Packages

### 1. Data Acquisition:
* Set up a mechanism to fetch the parking violation data from the provided data source.
* Set up a mechanism to fetch the street directory data from the provided data source.

2. Data Preprocessing:
* Clean and preprocess the parking violation data, removing any irrelevant or inconsistent entries.
* Clean and preprocess the street directory data, ensuring data quality and consistency.

### 3. Data Integration:
* Combine the parking violation data with the street directory data based on location information.
* Perform data merging and consolidation to create a unified dataset for analysis.

### 4. Exploratory Data Analysis:
* Conduct exploratory data analysis on the merged dataset.
* Identify statistical patterns and trends in parking violations.
* Explore spatial distributions and correlations between parking violations and street characteristics.

### 5. Hotspot Identification:
* Apply clustering or spatial analysis techniques to identify areas or streets with the highest frequency of parking violations.
* Determine the criteria for defining parking violation hotspots based on the analysis results.

### 6. Visualization and Insights:
* Create visualizations, such as maps or heatmaps, to illustrate the identified parking violation hotspots.
* Generate data-driven insights and recommendations for urban planners, law enforcement agencies, and parking management companies.
* Provide actionable recommendations for addressing parking violations in the identified hotspots.

### 7. Documentation and Reporting:
* Document the project process, including data acquisition, preprocessing, analysis, and visualization.
* Prepare a comprehensive report summarizing the findings, insights, and recommendations.
* Present the results to stakeholders, highlighting the significance and potential impact of the analysis.
