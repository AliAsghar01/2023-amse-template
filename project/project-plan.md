# Project Plan

## Summary

This project aims to analyze the relationship between the number of passenger cars and CO2 emissions in different areas of Germany, using data on monitoring CO2 emissions from passenger cars and the total registered cars in the area. The analysis can help identify areas with significant emissions and the factors contributing to them, which can inform interventions to reduce emissions and promote sustainable transportation.

## Rationale

The transportation sector is a significant contributor to greenhouse gas emissions, and reducing these emissions is crucial to mitigating climate change. By analyzing the relationship between the number of passenger cars and CO2 emissions, this project can help identify the areas where interventions are most needed to reduce emissions. Understanding the factors contributing to significant emissions can also inform the development of policies and incentives to promote sustainable transportation.

## Datasources

## Datasource1: CO2 Emissions from Passenger Cars in Germany <br />
Metadata URL: https://data.europa.eu/data/datasets/dat-116-en?locale=en  <br />

Data URL: https://opendata.stadt-muenster.de/sites/default/files/Fahrzeugbestand-Regierungsbezirk-Muenster-2018-2022.xlsx  <br />
Data Type: XLSX

This dataset contains information on the total number of registered cars in different areas of Germany.

## Work Packages

1. Download and clean the datasets, including handling missing data, transforming data types, and merging the datasets into a single dataset.

2. Perform exploratory data analysis to understand the trends and patterns in the data, including visualizations and summary statistics.

3. Analyze the correlation between the number of passenger cars and CO2 emissions, as well as the factors contributing to significant emissions.

4. Conduct a spatial analysis to identify the areas with the highest emissions and potential interventions to reduce emissions.

5. Summarize the findings and make recommendations for interventions and policies to promote sustainable transportation and reduce emissions.
